1. Open Postman
2. Create a New Request
Click on the "New" button or the "+" tab to create a new request.
3. Set Request Type to POST
In the dropdown menu on the left side of the tab, select POST.
4. Enter Request URL
In the URL field, enter the endpoint where your PHP script is accessible. Based on your previous message, if your PHP service is running on localhost and port 8080, and assuming your PHP file is named carnet.php, the URL would be:
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/carnet.php
5. Set Headers
Go to the "Headers" tab just below the URL field.
You will need to set the Content-Type header to application/json to tell your PHP application that you're sending JSON data. To do this:
In the "Key" field, enter Content-Type.
In the "Value" field, enter application/json.
6. Set Body
Click on the "Body" tab.
Select the "raw" radio button.
From the dropdown on the right (which defaults to "Text"), select JSON.
Enter your JSON data in the text field. For example:
json
Copy code
{
    "date": "2024-02-23",
    "title": "My First Journal Entry",
    "story": "Today, I learned how to use Docker with PHP and SQLite."
}
7. Send the Request
Click the "Send" button to submit your request to the PHP application.
8. Review the Response
The response will be displayed in the bottom pane of Postman. For a successful request, you should see a JSON response indicating that the journal entry was added successfully, something like:
json
Copy code
{"message": "Journal entry added successfully"}
This setup assumes that your Docker container with the PHP application is running and accessible via the specified port on your localhost. If your setup differs or if you encounter any issues, you might need to adjust the request details accordingly.
